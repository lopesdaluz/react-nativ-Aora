# Aora Mobile App Project Overview

This mobile app is based on a tutorial video that walks through building a simple app with React Native. While following the tutorial, I encountered some issues, such as the nativedwind bug, which I had to work around. The project is still in development, and many features are being implemented and refined.

## Features

- **Sign In**: Users can log in with their email and password.
- **Password Visibility Toggle**: Allows users to toggle the visibility of their password.
- **Navigation Links**: Easy navigation between sign-in and sign-up screens.

## Bugs and Workarounds

- **Bug**: nativedwind module could not be resolved.

  - **Solution**: Instead of using nativedwind, I chose to implement custom styling and navigation logic to move forward with the project.

- **Bug**: UI responsiveness issues on smaller screens.
  - **Solution**: Adjusted the layout for better compatibility across different screen sizes, but this will be further optimized.

## Ongoing Development

This project is still in progress, and many parts are subject to change. It's not yet a finished product, and I'm continuing to work on new features and improvements.
